# Atari-breakout-game
 
 In this project I built my own version of the famous Atari 2600 Breakout videogame using Java 8.
 
 I implemented the game in a GUI using Java swing and following an OOP coding style. The different files correspond to different elements of the game but the main logic can be found in <code>GamePanel.java</code>.
 
 # How to play?
 
 The game has six lines of blocks, where each color corresponds to a different number of points.
 
 •<code>Red</code> and <code>Orange</code> blocks correspond to 7 points.
 
 •<code>Yellow</code> and <code>Green</code> blocks correspond to 4 points.
 
 •<code>Aqua</code> and <code>Blue</code> blocks correspond to 1 points.
 
 The game ends when the player scores 360 points (the maximum number of points) or when they lose their 5 lives.
 
 # Run the Game
 
 To run the game you just need to compile and run the file <code>Breakout.java</code>.
